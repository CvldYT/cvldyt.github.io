							<h1 class="major">Cirtifications</h1>
							<p>While attending my High School, I chose to to take on a dual enrollment program, where I would study Adobes' 'Intro to Graphic Design' I ended up doing that for around 1 year (My freshman year in High School) I eventually passed the course, and recived my Adobe Certified Associate (ACA).</p>
							<p>I ended up doing art and online renders for YouTubers, some big some small, and that helped me really get my head into the game when it came to design. And that experience is really just what powered me through the tough life that I had at the time.</p>
						<h1 class="major">Workplace Experience</h1>
						<p>During my time with Adobe I needed to suppliment my income, so I chose to work with a design team in a real estate company in my town, this company (A-Team) worked with teens in the media field giving them a chance to be a paid intern and to work with other large companies to create advertisiments, and video ads. I learned a TON about the functioning
							of a business, as well as how to manage my time acordingly, to premote myself to higher positions.</p>
